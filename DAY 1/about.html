        <h4>EXPERIENCE</h4>
        <p>
            As a first-year student, I am currently in the early stages of building my experience. While I do not have
            extensive hands-on experience yet, I am actively exploring different technologies and learning through
            coursework, online resources, and small practice projects. I am eager to gain as much exposure as possible,
            improve my technical skills, and understand real-world applications by continuously experimenting and
            learning new tools and concepts.
