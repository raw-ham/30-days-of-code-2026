            <h4>Experience</h4>
            <p>
                As a first-year student, I am currently in the early stages of building my experience. While I do not
                have
                extensive hands-on experience yet, I am actively exploring different technologies and learning through
                coursework, online resources, and small practice projects. I am eager to gain as much exposure as
                possible,
                improve my technical skills, and understand real-world applications by continuously experimenting and
                learning new tools and concepts.
